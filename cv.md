## Profile

With a background in Management Consulting and Marketing for over 2 years, in the commercial/FinTech industry, I embarked on a journey to learn to code. Upon completing [Le Wagon's](https://www.lewagon.com) 450 hour bootcamp, in London, I'm comfortable with the full stack. I'm interested in producing high-quality interfaces for client-side applications.

I am university educated with an MSc Management (Distinction) from UCL. I immersed myself in Codecademy & FreeCodeCamp in my free time. I worked alongside a team of expert developers, as part of a crypto-startup and saw a trading app launch from idea to production.

My job is not solely to write code. My aim is to deliver an exceptionally functional end product, which adheres to high standards for all platforms.

Though my coding career is just beginning, I’ve moulded myself into a well-rounded individual through my consulting experiences, who appreciates best practice and progressively keeps up with new web technologies.
